<h2>Where would you go?</h2>
<p>If I could go anywhere, I would go to Japan. The first place I would visit in Japan is Tokyo. Tokyo is one of the most influential cities in the country and is similar to our version of Times Square in New York. The vibrant cityscape is beautifully captured in Figure 1, which shows an aerial view of an intersection in Ginza, Tokyo (Sorasak, n.d.). The next place I would visit is Osaka, which is known for having some of the best food in Japan. Finally, I would visit Kyoto. I have always been amazed by Japanese culture, and Kyoto is the hub of the nation’s history. Figure 2 illustrates the traditional architecture found in Kyoto (Sorasak, n.d.).</p>

<h2>What would you do?</h2>
<p>If I could do anything in Japan, I would first go to Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing. I would try to take photos there with my friends. It is a very busy intersection, so it’s a race to get to the center first and take a nice photo. Figure 3 shows people walking on a busy street in Tokyo, which reflects the lively atmosphere of Shibuya Crossing (Jezael, n.d.). Then I would go to Harajuku, which is the fashion capital, and it would be amazing to go there and buy some new clothes. I would also try the Mario Kart Street Go-Karts. In Japan, you can go Go-Kart racing, and while I am not the best driver, I feel that this would be a great experience. Finally, I would go to Osaka to visit some of the temples. Shitenno-ji is an amazing temple in Osaka. I love to meditate, so meditating in an actual temple would be a memorable experience.</p>

<h2>What would you eat?</h2>
<p>I would eat everything in Japan if I could. I love trying out new foods. I would first go to Kyoto for some traditional Japanese dishes. I would love to try Nishiki Market, where they have bento, mochi, and my favorite—seafood. I would also go to Tokyo to try wagyu. I have tried wagyu in America, but I want to compare it to the wagyu in Japan. Finally, I would have to try ramen and sushi. I eat a lot of both of those foods, so eating the authentic versions would be a great experience.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nishiki Market snacks (bento, mochi, seafood)</li>
    <li>Authentic Tokyo wagyu</li>
    <li>Traditional ramen from local shops</li>
    <li>Fresh sushi prepared by expert chefs</li>
</ul>
